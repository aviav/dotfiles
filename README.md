# Personal dotfiles of Moritz Breit

These are my personal dotfiles. Use at your own risk.
They contain configuration for zsh, vim and tmux.
If you have any questions, contact me.

## Installation

Clone this repository to ~/.local/dotfiles, then run
the installation with `rake install`.

```bash
cd ~/.local
git clone https://github.com/mbreit/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
rake install
```

Please note that this Rakefile is written for Ubuntu systems.
If you are on another OS, look at the output of `rake -T`
and use the `install:*` tasks manually.
